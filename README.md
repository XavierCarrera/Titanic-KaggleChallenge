<h2> About this project: </h2>

In this notebook, we use Machine Learning to make a prediction about what persons had better chances to survive the Titanic disaster. 

This is project is part of Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description : </h2>

The idea of this project is to use the available data to predict what type of individuals where more likely to survive to the Titanic disaster, using the available data from passengers that include sex, age, traveling class, place of departure, ticket fare, etc.

In order to get a sense of our data, we make an EDA while using viz libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. During the EDA, we observe the characteristics of people aboard the ship and those who survived.

Finally, we use the ScikitLearn library to make our prediction based on Machine Learning. In particular, we use four differente algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forests. In order to measure the accuracy of our model, we use crossvalidation. Our accuracy scores range from 77 to 79%. 

The final outcome is a prediction which is compared to the data of actual survivors.
